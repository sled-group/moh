For example: obj1: class, obj2: class, obj3: class, obj4: class, obj5: class. Replace class with the actual names of the classes from your class list. Ensure that no placeholders or brackets are used around the class names and that no additional words or punctuation are added to the response.

For example: obj1: class, obj2: class, obj3: class, obj4: class, obj5: class. Replace class with the actual names of the classes from your class list. Ensure that no placeholders or brackets are used around the class names and that no additional words or punctuation are added to the response.

prompt:  Given the classes: arm, armchair, bed, book, bottle, box, building, cabinet, car, ceiling, chair, column, curtain, cushion, door, drawer, fence, floors, flower, glass, grass, handle, head, lamp, leg, light, light source, mirror, mountain, pane, person, picture, pillow, plant, plate, pole, pot, road, rock, seat, shelf, sign, sofa, spotlight, streetlight, table, tree, vase, wheel, window. There are five red bounding boxes in this image. For each object within the red bounding boxes, identify its class from the list. Provide the class names in the format: 'obj1: <class1>, obj2: <class2>, obj3: <class3>, obj4: <class4>, obj5: <class5>', with no additional words or punctuation. For example: obj1: class, obj2: class, obj3: class, obj4: class, obj5: class. Replace class with the actual names of the classes from your class list. Ensure that no placeholders or brackets are used around the class names and that no additional words or punctuation are added to the response.
OPERA's output:

prompt:  Given the classes: arm, armchair, bed, book, bottle, box, building, cabinet, car, ceiling, chair, column, curtain, cushion, door, drawer, fence, floors, flower, glass, grass, handle, head, lamp, leg, light, light source, mirror, mountain, pane, person, picture, pillow, plant, plate, pole, pot, road, rock, seat, shelf, sign, sofa, spotlight, streetlight, table, tree, vase, wheel, window. There are five red bounding boxes in this image. For each object within the red bounding boxes, identify its class from the list. Provide the class names in the format: 'obj1: <class1>, obj2: <class2>, obj3: <class3>, obj4: <class4>, obj5: <class5>', with no additional words or punctuation. For example: obj1: class, obj2: class, obj3: class, obj4: class, obj5: class. Replace class with the actual names of the classes from your class list. Ensure that no placeholders or brackets are used around the class names and that no additional words or punctuation are added to the response.
OPERA's output:
obj1: lamp, obj2: lamp, obj3: lamp, obj4: lamp, obj5: lamp
